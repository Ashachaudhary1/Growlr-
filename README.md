# Growlr
Countless dogs are returned to shelters everyday--usually due to contradicting personalities. For example: The Siberian husky is one of the most re-homed dogs because people often don't realize how energetic they are, and how often their required to be walked. 
When a dog is rehomed, this can effect their mental heath, which can cause behavioral issues, like separation anxiety. 

# How Can Growlr Help?

This program is designed to match you with a breed, based on your life details and personality traits. The program then shows you adoptable dogs in your area, that match your criteria, using the Petfinder API. 

## Current Development

This is currently in beginning stages and has a "walk up and find your match" interface, with no registering required. Future development could enable profile integration, a more enhanced matching algorithm and other animals. 

## Algorithm

In addition to this algorithm, Growlr also uses the Petfinder API's filtering queries. If you have children or other pets, Growlr will only show you adoptable dogs that are recorded as being good with children, or good with other dogs/cats.

## Kiosk

Using a 7" touch screen, a recycled dog house, and a nifty painting job, the Growlr Kiosk is designed to catch a users attention, enticing them to walk up to the kiosk, and find their match.
